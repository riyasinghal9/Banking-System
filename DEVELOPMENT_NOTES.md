# Development Notes

## Project Setup (2024-01-15)

Started this banking system project after getting requirements from the client. 
Decided to use Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL stack for reliability and performance.

### Initial Architecture Decisions
- Chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB for ACID compliance (critical for banking)
- JWT for authentication (stateless, scalable)
- Winston for logging (better than console.log in production)
- Jest for testing (industry standard)

## Development Progress

### Week 1 (2024-01-15 to 2024-01-22)
- [x] Set up basic Express server
- [x] Database schema design
- [x] Basic CRUD operations for customers
- [x] Authentication system

### Week 2 (2024-01-22 to 2024-01-29)
- [x] Account management
- [x] Transaction processing
- [x] Security middleware
- [x] Input validation

### Week 3 (2024-01-29 to 2024-02-05)
- [x] Testing suite
- [x] API documentation
- [x] Error handling
- [x] Logging implementation

## Issues Encountered

### Database Connection Issues
Had problems with connection pooling initially. Fixed by adjusting pool settings.

### Transaction Atomicity
Spent a lot of time ensuring transfers are atomic. Used database transactions with proper rollback.

### Security Concerns
- Initially forgot to hash passwords (major security issue!)
- Had to add rate limiting after seeing suspicious activity in logs
- CORS configuration was tricky for frontend integration

## TODO List

### High Priority
- [ ] Add request ID middleware for better tracing
- [ ] Implement soft delete for customers (regulatory requirement)
- [ ] Add email verification system
- [ ] Audit trail for all operations

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add search functionality for customers
- [ ] Implement account freezing/unfreezing
- [ ] Add transaction limits per account type
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets

### Low Priority
- [ ] Multi-currency support
- [ ] Interest calculation automation
- [ ] Advanced reporting features
- [ ] Mobile app API endpoints

## Code Quality Notes

### What I'm Proud Of
- Clean separation of concerns (models, routes, middleware)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Good test coverage
- Security best practices

### Areas for Improvement
- Some functions are getting too long (need refactoring)
- Could use more TypeScript for better type safety
- Database queries could be optimized further
- Need better API versioning strategy

## Performance Considerations

### Database
- Connection pooling configured for 20 max connections
- Indexes on frequently queried fields
- Proper foreign key constraints

### Application
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Request/response logging for monitoring
- Graceful shutdown handling

## Security Measures

### Implemented
- JWT authentication with expiration
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting per IP
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection protection
- CORS configuration
- Security headers with Helmet

### Future Security Enhancements
- Two-factor authentication
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- IP whitelisting for admin accounts
- Regular security audits

## Testing Strategy

### Current Coverage
- Unit tests for models
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Service layer tests for business logic
- Health check endpoint test

### Test Data
Using seed data for consistent testing. Includes:
- 4 sample customers
- 6 sample accounts
- 5 users (4 customers + 1 admin)
- 6 initial transactions

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Setup
- Development: local PostgreSQL
- Staging: AWS RDS PostgreSQL
- Production: TBD (client decision pending)

### Configuration
- Environment variables for all sensitive data
- Separate configs for dev/staging/prod
- Logging levels configurable per environment

## Client Feedback

### Positive
- Clean API design
- Good error messages
- Comprehensive documentation
- Security features

### Requests for Changes
- Need better transaction history filtering
- Want real-time balance updates
- Request for mobile-optimized endpoints
- Need more detailed audit logs

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with security** - Don't add it as an afterthought
2. **Test early and often** - Saves time in the long run
3. **Document as you go** - Much easier than retrofitting
4. **Plan for scale** - Even if not needed initially
5. **Client communication** - Regular updates prevent scope creep

## Next Steps

1. Address high-priority TODOs
2. Client review and feedback incorporation
3. Performance testing with larger datasets
4. Security audit by third party
5. Production deployment planning
